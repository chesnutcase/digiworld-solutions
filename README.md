# DigiWorld Solutions (Annotated)

This repository aims to provided **annotated solutions** (i.e. with explanations, guides and tutorials) to all questions seen in the Singapore University of ~~Technical Difficulties~~  (SUTD)'s *10.009 – The Digital World* module (basically a 12-week introductory to python course that has "machine learning" jammed in for marketing wank).

For future problem sets released after the creation of this repository, solutions will only be released after the submission deadline of the problem set has passed.

For past problem sets released before the creation of this repository, solutions will be released whenever I / some kind soul has time to make solutions for it.

Please create a GitHub account and star and follow this repository if you wish to receive notifications whenever new solutions are posted.

## How to use this repository

On the top right hand corner of this page, press the "Download Zip" button. Individual files can be download by opening the file in Github, clicking on "View Raw" and saving the contents of the resulting page.

The root of the repository is organised into years. Inside each year folder you should find categories such as `psets`, `midterm`, `quiz` and `final`.

Each "solution", in most cases, is stored in a Juyputer Notebook file, to provide interactive walkthroughs of the problems.

## Some warnings regarding distribution

In the spirit of SUTD's collaborative learning, the faculty has banned uploading past year solutions to places like Github and Google Drive. This is the reason why this repository is hosted on my personal profile and not [OpenSUTD](https://github.com/OpenSUTD) – the faculty explicitly forbids it.

### If you are a student

This repository is aimed to help you **learn**, not copy answers. If your year's Problem Set questions happen to be the same as past years, you would be doing **a great disservice** to yourself and the SUTD community by copying and submitting solutions from this repository. **The faculty runs plagiarism checkers and they will pick up your copy and penalise you for it**.

Also, please don't go waving this repository around the faculty's faces. They are humans and don't like stuff being waved in front of their face like you and me.

### If you are a faculty

If your future problem sets are still going to be copy-pasta'd like what you did circa 2014 till 2019 and find issue with students copying solutions from here, then you gotta start making fresh problem sets.

If you take issue with students learning from past year exam solutions "because it makes studying too easy", then you need to rethink your idea of what SUTD's unique learning pedagogy really is.

These solutions and tutorials **are my work protected under the MIT License**. You cannot take down this repository. Deal with it.
